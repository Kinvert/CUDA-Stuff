# Closest Pair of Points

This one was really frustrating trying to use ChatGPT so I just gave up on it and wrote some of these myself.

### 04

Gave up on ChatGPT and wrote 03 and this one also.

### 09

Wrote this one myself. It has a race condition. If you do a print in the distance function it seems to take long enough to sort of fix that. Will try to come back and do this better without ruining the parallel speed.
