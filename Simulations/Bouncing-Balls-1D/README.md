Certainly! Here is a possible readme for the programs in the folder:

# Bouncing Balls Simulation

**Note: It guessed these filenames, the curand one is wrong no curand was used at the time this readme was made, also openmp was never used**

This folder contains 5 programs that demonstrate how to improve the performance of a bouncing balls simulation using parallel processing. The programs are:

bouncing_balls.cpp: This is a simple C++ program that simulates the bouncing of 1000 balls for 1000 time steps. The balls are initialized with random positions, and their positions and velocities are updated at each time step. The final positions of the balls are printed to the console.

bouncing_balls_cuda.cu: This is a CUDA program that uses the GPU to simulate the bouncing of 1000 balls for 1000 time steps. The balls are initialized with random positions on the GPU, and their positions and velocities are updated at each time step using two CUDA kernels. The final positions of the balls are copied back to the host (CPU) and printed to the console.

bouncing_balls_cuda_curand.cu: This is a CUDA program that uses the GPU to simulate the bouncing of 1000 balls for 1000 time steps, and also uses the curand library to generate random numbers on the GPU. The balls are initialized with random positions using curand, and their positions and velocities are updated at each time step using two CUDA kernels. The final positions of the balls are copied back to the host (CPU) and printed to the console.

bouncing_balls_openmp.cpp: This is a C++ program that uses OpenMP to simulate the bouncing of 1000 balls for 1000 time steps. The balls are initialized with random positions, and their positions and velocities are updated at each time step using OpenMP parallel regions. The final positions of the balls are printed to the console.

bouncing_balls_openmp_simd.cpp: This is a C++ program that uses OpenMP and SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) instructions to simulate the bouncing of 1000 balls for 1000 time steps. The balls are initialized with random positions, and their positions and velocities are updated at each time step using OpenMP parallel regions and SIMD instructions. The final positions of the balls are printed to the console.

To build and run the programs, you will need a C++ compiler (such as g++) and a CUDA compiler (such as nvcc). You will also need to have OpenMP and the curand library installed.

To build the programs, you can use the following commands:

```cpp
g++ bouncing_balls.cpp -o bouncing_balls.out
nvcc bouncing_balls_cuda.cu -o bouncing_balls_cuda.out
nvcc bouncing_balls_cuda_curand.cu -o bouncing_balls_cuda_curand
```
