# Numerical

My textbook was Applied Numerical Analysis by Gerald and Wheatley

I'll probably be outlining similar to them and trying to find things in there I can do in parallel with CUDA.

If you do buy this book I recommend against the soft cover my school sold. The pages started falling out 1/4 through the semester.
